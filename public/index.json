Because of their short forms, many interpretations don\u0026rsquo;t hold. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe in an essence of such a complex reality, but I like finding it.\n   Reason is not what led you to opinion, but a convincing story. The only feature such story has is to be convincing, but not necessarily to be true. Most people don\u0026rsquo;t know and don\u0026rsquo;t think about the reason, but can create a story behind it which can, but mostly is not the reason wich led them to their opinion.\n  People have two states of living. The experiencing and remembering self. The experiencing self is mainly driven by intuition and emotion and less important. People experience to form memories not to experience. When remembering, time is irrelevant, but time is the variable of live, wich forms a paradox of living and a difference between experience and memories.\n  There are two states or systems of thinking. Thinking intuitively fast without knowing the reason and reasonably slow with algorithms and consciousness.\n  A concept has properties, concepts. These concepts are iterative, building a tree. Humans don\u0026rsquo;t need to understand a concept and it\u0026rsquo;s properties fully to work with it. Intuition can fill lacking knowledge about an concept, with an educated guess. It works very well, unless a property of an concept is significant. Intelligence is the grade of the ability to create, modify and recombine concepts. Consciousness is the grade of the ability to iterate concepts upwards, towards meta–layers. Iterating upwards comes to the same unknown sense as iterating downwards. Because a concept depends on it\u0026rsquo;s properties and so on, nothing is real, because humans did not reach an end of a concept. A real concept is currently a illusion. Part of research and religion is to dismantle the illusion, with further ignorance or, but uncertain discovered, truth.\n  Humans are intelligent. Intelligence is the ability to trade order with heat.\n  To cover up not knowing, humans live in ignorance. Basic human instincts create the illusion of meaning by reward and punishment through subconscious protective measurements.\n  If a new consciousness with the memory of a previous consciousness is created then the illusion of continuity of consciousness can be contained, because the new consciousness still believes in it being the old.\n  Imperfect people make good and bad only under the definition of imperfect people.\n  Abuse is misusing something directed towards disfunction or a different meaning. Only Empathy can judge an administrator responsible or even guilty. For something to be abused it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to suffer, but the observants can.\n  Abstraction destroys empathy.\n  Good and Evil, True and False gets more broadly defined with a growing group. On the individual level, these binary options can, but mostly don\u0026rsquo;t, differ extremely. On a spectator\u0026rsquo;s level, these terms will be judged, but are, for the individual, the reality, as they are a compromises in values wich can be weighted contrasting.\n  The will to live happily defines humans beliefs, such as morals and religion. Humans are enslaved in their instincts and subconscious on a higher level. If some of it even partially is removed, religion and other believes become meaningless for them.\n  Does a plot without a story have meaning?\n  If there was no story of god, but god, would he posses any meaning. When god has an aim, he is no god, because he underlies higher principals. For one to be god, he must not be influenced by his reality.\n  Humans are humane. What breaks relationships is a inhumane expectancy, like marriage.\n  To live a life most immersive is to live it like described in a book.\n  We don\u0026rsquo;t exist in a physical world. We exist in the story our brain tells itself.\n  Intelligence is the grade of the ability to model. To prove humans are generally intelligent, they have to model them self, e.g. create a general intelligence.\n  Consciousness is a simulated property that simulates itself.\n  Spirit is an operating system for an autonomous robot.\n  An organism is not a collection if cells, it is a function which tells cells how to behave.\n  Genisis is the the childhood memory of a good. He discovers light and darkness, land, water, animals and plants, gives them names and at last, people.\n  Thought process of a theist: Something is moving, so there must be a mover. What does make the mover to move? So there must be a prime mover. But it physical reality is an cellular automaton. It creates information with complexity. Nothing is being moved. It is a wave of changing states.\n  Because identity is something one can change and not something what is, you can also kill yourself mentally. This gives your host the chance of happyness. It can also lead to uncontrollable personal disorder and may relive the problem of your host.\n  Rainbows are caustics. They are formed by light tangently bouncing around in a circle or sphere. This is also reproducible with shining a flashlight into a mug.\n  Helping someone religious is like to help someone out of an abusive relationship. You really can\u0026rsquo;t do much besides being there.\n  The second Turing test: In this century, humans will have to prove if they can build an overall better automata than themselves. If that\u0026rsquo;s the case, a positive feedback loop is created which will probably lead to a singularity. Because humans build something that is smarter than them, that something must be able to improve on that, because it is smarter than humans and so on.\n  The emotional human wants an emotional world, the rational simply doesn\u0026rsquo;t vote.\n  In Christianity, god is somebody with root rights. The devil also is admin, but he is a hacker.\n  Physics is simulating the reality. For one to say emotions and similar aren\u0026rsquo;t able to be simulated, is to say the universe is not a turing machine.\n  Because the universe is only to be observed, not to be locked up, because there is no difference between a simulation and \u0026ldquo;reality\u0026rdquo;, truth is not existent, but the most suitable encoding to an observed state.\n  Because neurons don\u0026rsquo;t work at 20kH, more like 20Hertz, sound needs to get translated into energy instead of frequency. That\u0026rsquo;s what the gehörkanal does.\n  Evolution ist für uns eigentlich bekannt als der Prozess der von einem simplen chemischen Automat zu uns führt, der Natur. Aber das lässt sich noch erweitern. In der Physik sind Evolutionsgleichungen solche die ein System über Zeit entwickeln, wie beispielsweise in der Simulation eines Mehrkörpersystems oder dem Verlauf eines Lichtstrahles über Reflexionen. Diese können von einfachen Regeln zu einem komplexen Ergebnis führen, welches aus dem Integral über Zeit entstand. Als ich neulich die \u0026ldquo;Terra Mineralia\u0026rdquo; in Freiberg besuchte, wurde mir klar, das zumindest visuell das Leben in seiner Komplexität aus Evolution nicht anleine steht, denn solche Kristalle, so einzigartig in Farbe, Geometrie und Material lassen sich klassifizieren wie es ein Biologe mit dem Leben tut.\n  Wespen stören uns. Wir können nichts gegen sie tun. Mich fasziniert aber, wie emotional Menschen wegen Wespen werden, bewusst das Wespen gesellschaftlich irrelevant sind. Wie Menschen in ihrer Wut simple Rationalität verlieren ist erstaunlich. Zudem ist ja die Emotionalität des Menschen in Frage zu stellen. Oder nicht? Es ist eine unentscheidbare Frage, da der Mensch emotional ist. Seine Antwort ist emotional, wie kann er dann die Emotion wegrationalisieren?\n  Was in der Schule \u0026ldquo;Streber\u0026rdquo; sind, sind oft einfach Menschen besonders indoktriniert von bürgerlichen Werten. Fast jeder Mensch strebt, das muss aber nicht bedeuten das er sein Latein kann. Auch die negative Konnotation ist unberechtigt, spiele sie doch auf das Können-wollen ein und nicht auf das Unbewusstheit des Strebers seiner Unfreiheit die ich diesem Cliche zuordnen würde.\n  Heiraten wurde in einem Zeitalter erfunden, wo Menschen nicht einmahl halb so Alt wurden wie heute. Mehr als 50% der Ehen scheitern. Es gibt keine rationale Begründung für Monogamie. Man verspricht sich in der Heirat ewige Treue, wenn ich meinem Partner unendlich vertraue, weshalb muss ich dann einen Vertrag anlegen, der das Ende dieser Treue verurteilt? Natürlich kann jeder heiraten und sich scheiden lassen wie er will, ich habe das aber nicht vor.\n  Ein wesentlicher Schwachpunkt menschlicher Begründung ist die Wegrationalisierung logischer Zweige und Mengen die intuitiv irrelevant erscheinen oder keiner Beachtung würdig wurden da eine andere Antwort schon Genüge tat, sowie das Unverständnis von Definition und Deklaration in der Logik. Der Mensch optimiert nicht nach der Wahrheit sondern nach der einfachsten Repräsentation einer komplexen Geschichte. Das aktive Vervollständigen des aktuellen Verstandes geschieht mithilfe der wissenschaftlichen Methode.\n  Sherlock is wrong in saying \u0026ldquo;If you exclude all possibilities, the remaining must be the truth\u0026rdquo;, because he can\u0026rsquo;t know all possibilities. After all they could be for example supernatural.\n  ","permalink":"http://m4dh0rs3.github.io/posts/showerthoughts/","summary":"These are thoughts, not necessarily truths.
