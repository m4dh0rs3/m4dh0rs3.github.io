      <description>These are thoughts, not necessarily truths. Because of their short forms, many interpretations don&amp;rsquo;t hold. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe in an essence of such a complex reality, but I like finding it.
   Reason is not what led you to opinion, but a convincing story. The only feature such story has is to be convincing, but not necessarily to be true. Most people don&amp;rsquo;t know and don&amp;rsquo;t think about the reason, but can create a story behind it which can, but mostly is not the reason wich led them to their opinion.</description>
